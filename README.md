Objectives:
-----

* ✓ You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* ✓ Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* ✓ The username and email are unique.
* ✓ Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* ✓ Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

Bonus:
-----

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.
* ✓ Work on the CSS to make it look good.

## Prerequisites

* Postgresql

## Setting up the app

```
git clone https://github.com/ConorButler/chitter-challenge.git
cd chitter-challenge
bundle install
rake setup
rake populate_database
rspec
```
This will set up a chitter and chitter_test database, which are configured to run during normal usage and testing respectively. A set of posts will be generated by a random user at a random time in the last few months after running populate_database. 

## Using the app

Whilst inside the chitter-challenge directory:
```
rackup
```

Visit http://localhost:9292

Notes:
* You need to be logged in to peep. Head over to the Sign up page by clicking on the right
* You must use a unique email and username when signing up
* You can log out and log in as someone else, post again, and it will be authored by the other user

-----
## Additional technologies used
* Timecop gem for testing the time sensitive aspect of the app (viewing tweets in reverse chronological order). Let's you freeze time objects and pass in specific times.
* Bcrypt for hashing passwords.
* Sinatra flash messages for handling unhappy paths.
* Rake for setting up the database for testing, as well as making it easy to set up for anyone cloning this repo. I made my own script to populate the database with some dummy posts.
